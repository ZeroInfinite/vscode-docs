# Adding Snippets to Visual Studio Code

Code snippets are templates that make it easier to enter repeating code patterns, such as loops or conditional-statements.

Snippets show in IntelliSense (`kb(editor.action.triggerSuggest)`) mixed with other suggestions as well as in a dedicated snippet picker (**Insert Snippet** in the Command Palette). There is also support for tab-completion: Enable it with `"editor.tabCompletion": true`, type a *snippet prefix*, and press `kb(insertSnippet)` to insert a snippet.

The snippet syntax follows the [TextMate snippet syntax](https://manual.macromates.com/en/snippets) with the exception of 'regular expression replacements', 'interpolated shell code' and 'transformations', which are not supported.

## Add Snippets from the Marketplace

Many [extensions](/docs/editor/extension-gallery.md) on the VS Code [Marketplace](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/vscode) include snippets.  If you find one you want to use, simply install it and restart VS Code and the new snippet will be available (see [here](/docs/editor/extension-gallery#_browse-and-install-extensions-in-vs-code) for more instructions on installing an extension).

Below are some popular extensions which include snippets in their language support:

## Creating your Own Snippets

You can define your own snippets for specific languages.  To open up a snippet file for editing, open **User Snippets** under **File** > **Preferences** (**Code** > **Preferences** on Mac) and select the language for which the snippets should appear.

Snippets are defined in a JSON format and stored in a per user `(languageId).json` file. For example, Markdown snippets go in a `markdown.json` file.

The example below is a `For Loop` snippet for `JavaScript`.

```json
    "For Loop": {
        "prefix": "for",
        "body": [
            "for (var ${1:index} = 0; ${1:index} < ${2:array}.length; ${1:index}++) {",
            "\tvar ${3:element} = ${2:array}[${1:index}];",
            "\t$0",
            "}"
        ],
        "description": "For Loop"
    },
```

In the example above:

* `For Loop` is the snippet name
* `prefix` defines how this snippet is selected from IntelliSense and tab completion. In this case `for`. 
* `body` is the content and either a single string or an array of strings of which each element will be inserted as separate line.
* `description` is the description used in the IntelliSense drop down

The example above has three placeholders, `${1:index}`, `${2:array}`, and `${3:element}`. You can quickly traverse them in the order of their number. The string after the number and colon is filled in as default.

Once you have added a new snippet, you can try it out right away, no restart needed.

## Snippet Syntax

The `body` of a snippet can use special constructs to control cursors and the text being inserted. The following are supported features and their syntaxes:

### Tabstops

With tabstops you can make the editor cursor move inside a snippet. Use `$1`, `$2` to specify cursor locations. The number is the order in which tabstops will be visited, whereas `$0` denotes the final cursor position. Multiple tabstops are linked and updated in sync.

### Placeholders

Placeholders are tabstops with values, like `${1:foo}`. The placeholder text will be inserted and selected such that it can be easily changed. Placeholders can be nested, like `${1:another ${2:placeholder}}`.

### Variables

With `$name` or `${name:default}` you can insert the value of a variable. When a variable isn’t set its *default* or the empty string is inserted. When a variable is unknown (that is, its name isn’t defined) the name of the variable is inserted and it is transformed into a placeholder. The following variables can be used:

* `TM_SELECTED_TEXT` The currently selected text or the empty string
* `TM_CURRENT_LINE` The contents of the current line
* `TM_CURRENT_WORD` The contents of the word under cursor or the empty string
* `TM_LINE_INDEX` The zero-index based line number
* `TM_LINE_NUMBER` The one-index based line number
* `TM_FILENAME` The filename of the current document
* `TM_DIRECTORY` The directory of the current document
* `TM_FILEPATH` The full file path of the current document


### Grammar

Below is the EBNF for snippets. With `\` (backslash) you can escape `$`, `}` and `\`.

```
any         ::= tabstop | placeholder | variable | text
tabstop     ::= '$' int | '${' int '}'
placeholder ::= '${' int ':' any '}'
variable    ::= '$' var | '${' var }' | '${' var ':' any '}'
var         ::= [_a-zA-Z] [_a-zA-Z0-9]*
int         ::= [0-9]+
text        ::= .*
```


## Using TextMate Snippets

You can also add TextMate snippets (.tmSnippets) to your VS Code installation using the [yo code](/docs/tools/yocode.md) extension generator. The generator has an option `New Code Snippets` which lets you point to a folder containing multiple .tmSnippets files and they will be packaged into a VS Code snippet extension.  The generator also supports Sublime snippets (.sublime-snippets). 

The final generator output has two files: an extension manifest `package.json` which has metadata to integrate the snippets into VS Code and a `snippets.json` file which includes the snippets converted to the VS Code snippet format.

```bash
.
├── snippets                    // VS Code integration
│   └── snippets.json           // The JSON file w/ the snippets
└── package.json                // extension's manifest
```

Copy the generated snippets folder to a new folder under [your `.vscode/extensions` folder](/docs/extensions/install-extension.md#your-extensions-folder) and restart VS Code.

## Sharing Your Snippets in the Marketplace

Once you have created your snippets and tested them out, you can share them with the community.

To do this, you need to create a snippet extension.  If you've used the `yo code` extension generator, your snippet extension is ready to be published.

If you want to share user snippets, you'll need to package your snippet json file along with an extension manifest which has the necessary metadata to integrate the snippets into VS Code.

Depending on your platform, your user snippets file is located here:

* **Windows** `%APPDATA%\Code\User\snippets\(language).json`
* **Mac** `$HOME/Library/Application Support/Code/User/snippets/(language).json`
* **Linux** `$HOME/.config/Code/User/snippets/(language).json`

where `(language).json` depends on the targeted language of the snippets (e.g. `markdown.json` for Markdown snippets).  Create a new folder for your extension and copy your snippet file to a `snippets` subdirectory.

Now add an extension manifest package.json file to the extension folder.  The snippet extension manifest follows the structure defined in the [Extension Manifest](/docs/extensionAPI/extension-manifest.md) reference and provides a [`snippets` contribution](/docs/extensionAPI/extension-points.md#contributessnippets).

Below is an example manifest for Markdown snippets:

```json
{
    "name": "DM-Markdown",
    "publisher": "mscott",
    "description": "Dunder Mifflin Markdown snippets",
    "version": "0.1.0",
    "engines": { "vscode": "0.10.x" },
    "categories": ["Snippets"], 
    "contributes": {
        "snippets": [
            {
                "language": "markdown",
                "path": "./snippets/markdown.json"
            }
        ]
    }
}
```

Note that snippets need to be associated with a `language` identifier.  This can be a [language supported](/docs/languages/overview.md) directly by VS Code or a language provided by an extension.  Make sure the `language` identifier is correct.

You then use the [vsce publishing tool](/docs/tools/vscecli.md) to publish the snippet extension to the [VS Code Extension Marketplace](/docs/editor/extension-gallery.md).

> **Tip:** To make it easy for users to find your snippet, include the word "snippet" in the extension description and set the `Category` to `Snippets` in your `package.json`.

We also have recommendations on how to make your extension look great on the VS Code Marketplace, see [Marketplace Presentation Tips](/docs/extensionAPI/extension-manifest.md#marketplace-presentation-tips).

## Common Questions

**Q: I created a snippets extension but they aren't showing up in the VS Code editor?**

**A:** Be sure you have correctly specified the `language` identifier for your snippet (e.g. `markdown` for Markdown .md files, `plaintext` for Plain Text .txt files).  Also verify that the relative path to the snippets json file is correct.
